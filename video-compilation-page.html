        <h1>The World of Pokemon</h1>
        <p>On this page, I'll talk about three major ways people interact with this franchise. These aren't all of them, but as per the requirements of this project, I'm only adding 3.</p>
        <section>
            <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <p>This is probably the most popular, and the main, way to interact with the franchise. You can play competitively, once for the experience, shiny hunt, and do so much more.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Trading Card Game</h2>
            <p>This is a popular way to interact with the franchise as well. Majority of people in this regard are collectors, but there is a small but dedicated community of players too, including myself.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Anime</h2>
            <p>While maybe not as mainstream as the other two, the anime remains a popular and consistent branch of the franchise, especially amongst younger individuals.</p>
